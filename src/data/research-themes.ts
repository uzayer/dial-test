 * DIAL's nine Research Themes, one per explicit `/research/<slug>` route.
 *
 * The taxonomy comes from the dial-test prototype, not from a capture: the only
 * captured list (DIAL Proposal.md, "Research Themes") has six different labels
 * (HCI; HCI and AI; XAI; Explainable ML; Vision; Low-cost Hardware and IoT), and
 * the NSU home page names five domains (Health, Accessibility, Women in STEM,
 * Financial Technology, Social Computing). Needs DIAL confirmation — see
 * labs/dial/identity.md. `shortDescription` is the prototype's card copy;
 * `featured` marks the prototype's original six home-page themes.
