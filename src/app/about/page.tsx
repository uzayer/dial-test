              Our research focuses on inclusivity and access for marginalised communities, building
              technology that is locally appropriate, low-cost, and explainable. We use
              participatory design and long-term fieldwork to understand problems from the inside,
              then build and evaluate technology with the people who will use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We collaborate across universities, funders, and partners to study inclusion, safety,
              wellbeing, and development, always with attention to constraints like language,
              bandwidth, devices, and trust.
