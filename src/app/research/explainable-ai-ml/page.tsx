        why: "An accuracy score is a claim made to the people who built the model. It is not an answer to a patient told that a scan looks abnormal, or to anyone told that an automated decision has gone against them. Where a decision arrives with no explanation and no route of appeal, the system has stopped being a tool and become a verdict. DIAL's work is on making algorithmic systems legible to non-experts — including the communities those systems are used on, who are rarely the ones shown the evaluation.",
