        why: "Who ends up in a computing programme is largely settled before any aptitude is measured: by which school had a working lab, whose family could spare the fees, who was permitted to travel to class, and who ever saw someone like themselves doing the work. DIAL's work here is on widening that entry in Bangladesh, and on the teaching and community structures that decide whether people stay once they have arrived — which is the half of the problem that recruitment drives consistently miss.",
