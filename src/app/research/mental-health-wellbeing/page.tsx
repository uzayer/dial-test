        plainly:
          "Digital mental health research asks what technology can honestly do where professional care is scarce — and, just as importantly, what it must never pretend to do.",
        why: "Most wellbeing apps assume someone who can already name what they are feeling, who has privacy on their own device, and who has a clinician to escalate to. Remove any one of those and the design does not merely underperform; it can do harm. DIAL's work is on tools and methods for care in settings where clinical infrastructure is thin and stigma is real — which means designing around disclosure, around families rather than individuals, and around the limits of what software should ever claim to be.",
