        plainly:
          "Feminist HCI is not research about women. It is the practice of asking, of any system, whose experience it was built around — and who absorbs the cost when that guess is wrong.",
        why: "Harassment, monitoring, and loss of privacy are not edge cases in the technology women use in Bangladesh; they are ordinary conditions of use. A safety feature designed for someone with a private phone and a supportive household does very little for someone whose device is shared and whose movements are watched. That is why this work is done with the women who will use the system rather than for them: the constraints that decide whether a design works are not visible from outside them.",
