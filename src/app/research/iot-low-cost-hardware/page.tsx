        plainly:
          "This is the unglamorous half of computing research: what a sensor costs, whether it survives the monsoon, and who can repair it when it fails.",
        why: "A prototype that works in a lab and costs more than a month's income is a demonstration, not an intervention. Infrastructure here is intermittent by default — power, connectivity, and the supply of spare parts all are — so a device's real specification includes its price, its repairability, and what it does once the network is gone. DIAL builds affordable sensing for exactly those conditions, which is a harder engineering problem than the expensive version, not an easier one.",
