        plainly:
          "Misinformation research is less about what is false than about why a false thing travels — who passes it on, and what they are right about that the correction gets wrong.",
        why: "Health rumours move through the same channels as trustworthy advice: family groups, neighbours, a pharmacist, a religious leader. A correction arriving from outside those channels, in the wrong language or the wrong register, does not land — and repeating a false claim in order to debunk it can carry it further than it would have gone. DIAL studies how this information moves in Bangladesh, and builds responses on the trust that already exists rather than on the assumption that facts win by themselves.",
