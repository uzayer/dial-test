        plainly:
          "ICTD — information and communication technologies for development — studies what actually happens when technology designed in one part of the world is deployed in another.",
        why: "The gap is rarely the hardware. It is language, literacy, bandwidth, cost per megabyte, who in a household owns the phone and who is allowed to use it, and whether the institution behind a service is trusted at all. A design that ignores those does not fail loudly — it is simply not adopted, and the non-adoption is then explained away as a problem with the users. DIAL treats those conditions as the design brief rather than as friction to be overcome.",
