        plainly:
          "Safety research asks who a system protects and from whom — questions with very different answers for someone whose threat is a stranger and someone whose threat shares their home.",
        why: "Standard security models assume the attacker is remote and the device is yours. A great deal of real harm fits neither: the phone is shared, the passcode is known to family, and the risk of being seen using a safety tool can exceed the risk it was built to address. DIAL co-designs protective systems with people living in those conditions, because a tool that cannot be used discreetly will not be used at all — and a safety feature nobody dares open is indistinguishable from no safety feature.",
