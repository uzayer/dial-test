 * they are set in greyscale at reduced strength to sit on the page as one row,
 * and take their colour back on hover. A partner with no logo on record falls
 * back to its name set as a wordmark.
 *
 * Below `lg`, partners are dealt round-robin into a few slots and each slot
 * cycles its own share, so the strip stays one line at any count. Each variant
 * is rendered and the breakpoint picks one with CSS, so the server-rendered
 * page already shows the right count with no swap on hydration. The logos sit
 * at a fixed gap from one another rather than spread across equal columns,
 * which on a wide screen left them stranded far apart. With reduced motion
 * every partner prints at once.
