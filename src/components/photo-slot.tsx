/**
 * A place where a photograph belongs.
 *
 * DIAL's own photographs are not in the prototype yet — the scraped Google
 * Sites URLs refuse hotlinks, and stock imagery would read as the Lab's own
 * work. So the slot prints a riso composition until a real photo arrives, and
 * a photo that fails to load falls back to the same drawing rather than a
 * broken frame. Every slot is a real place in the layout: when DIAL supplies
 * media, the pictures land here without the page being rebuilt around them.
 *
 * `caption` describes the slot, never the picture — no invented captions about
 * events that may not be what the photograph shows.
