/**
 * A note in the margin, in the hand.
 *
 * This is *not* a `MarginNote`. A MarginNote is decoration: it restates in
 * pencil something the page already sets in type, so it is `aria-hidden` and
 * dropped entirely on small screens. A FieldNote carries something the page
 * says nowhere else — a piece of the field's history, a term's origin — so it
 * is real content: readable at every width, in the accessibility tree, and
 * always attributed.
 *
 * The attribution is the whole discipline of the component. An unsourced "did
 * you know" is trivia, and trivia on a research lab's site reads as filler. A
 * sourced one is a citation set in pencil, which is exactly what a researcher
 * scribbles in a margin.
