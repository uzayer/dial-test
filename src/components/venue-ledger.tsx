 * Where the Lab publishes, as a ruled sheet of stamps rather than a line of

 *
 * To a reader inside the field, "CHI" and "TOCHI" are the strongest claim a
 * lab page can make, and they were set at the size of a footnote. Here each
 * venue gets a cell: the acronym at display size, what it stands for under it
 * (most visitors are not in the field), and the Lab's record there in mono —
 * how many papers, over which years. A venue where DIAL won an award wears the
 * rosette and the award's name, which is the one thing more prestigious than
 * being published there.
 *
 * Hairlines come from the grid's gap, as in ThemeSpotlight, so no cell doubles
 * its neighbour's rule. Two columns on a phone, three from `md`; on a phone
 * the acronym steps down so an eight-letter one (COMSNETS) stays in its cell.
